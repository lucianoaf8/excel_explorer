# Quick Code Review – `analyzer.py`

_Date: 2025-07-15 08:44 MDT_

## 1. High-level observations

* Several large in-class edits were merged manually, resulting in **duplicate method definitions** and **missing helpers**.
* Current file will not import/run due to an unresolved reference and duplicate symbols.
* Most business logic from prior checkpoints is still present but scattered; a small cleanup will restore functionality.

## 2. Blocking issues

| Issue | Impact | Lines |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `_analyze_data` defined **twice** | Later definition overrides earlier; maintenance confusion | ~153-233 and 266-345 |
| `_calculate_data_quality` duplicated | Same problem, increases file size & risk | ~238-264 and 350-380 |
| `_extract_sheet_headers` duplicated | Duplicate symbol | ~270-330 and ~378-430 |
| Helper `_compute_column_stats` **missing** but is referenced inside `_analyze_data` | **Runtime `AttributeError`** | reference at ~300-310 |
| Outline shows functions nested under the first `_calculate_data_quality` (Pyright reports) – caused by stray dedent when code was pasted | May push later helpers **outside** `SimpleExcelAnalyzer` if indentation drifted | various |

## 3. Recommended fixes (minimal)

1. **Keep only one copy** of each duplicate method – the newer versions (with progressive sampling etc.) appear from line ~266 onward.
2. **Re-add** helper `def _compute_column_stats(...)` inside `SimpleExcelAnalyzer` (just below `_calculate_data_quality`). Use the implementation previously drafted (timeout + memory safeguard).
3. Verify indentation: all helper defs should be indented **4 spaces** under `class SimpleExcelAnalyzer`.
4. Run `pyright` / `flake8` afterwards; ensure no undefined names or indentation errors remain.

> Estimated patch = delete ~150 redundant lines + paste 60-line helper.

---

## 4. Non-blocking / style notes

* Consider splitting very long methods (e.g., `_analyze_data`) into smaller helpers for readability.
* Data-quality and header-extraction helpers are currently public to the class; could be marked with a leading underscore in calls for clarity.
* Add basic unit tests for `_calculate_data_quality` and `_compute_column_stats` once stable.

## 5. Conclusion

The file is very close to working but requires a quick tidy-up:

1. Remove duplicates.
2. Restore `_compute_column_stats`.
3. Validate with a linter.

Once applied, the Excel Explorer analyzer should execute without import/runtime errors.
