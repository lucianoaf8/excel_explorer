## Overview
Restore comprehensive reporting functionality that was simplified during project reorganization phases.

## Current Issues
- Report generator simplified during refactoring
- Missing detailed sheet analysis sections
- Missing cross-sheet relationship analysis
- Missing comprehensive security analysis
- Interactive elements removed

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Code
```bash
# Create backup of current report generator
cp src/reports/structured_text_report.py src/reports/structured_text_report_backup.py
cp src/reports/report_generator.py src/reports/report_generator_backup.py
```

### Step 2: Replace Report Generator

### Step 3: Verify Analyzer Integration
Ensure analyzer.py is providing all necessary data fields:
- ✅ Cross-sheet relationships
- ✅ Security pattern detection
- ✅ Detailed column analysis
- ✅ Sample data extraction
- ✅ Data quality metrics

### Step 4: Test Integration
```bash
cd C:\Projects\excel_explorer
python main.py --analyze "path/to/test.xlsx"
```

### Step 5: Validate Output
Check that generated HTML reports contain:
- Multi-tab interface
- Expandable sheet sections
- Cross-sheet relationship tables
- Comprehensive security analysis
- Detailed column analysis
- Sample data previews
