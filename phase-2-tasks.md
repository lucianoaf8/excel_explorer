# Phase 2 Task List - Data Analysis Engine

## Task 1: ChunkedSheetProcessor Implementation

Create `src/utils/chunked_processor.py` with configurable row batch processing system (default: 10,000 rows), streaming data analysis with minimal memory footprint, lazy loading for sheets not currently analyzed, progress tracking and cancellation mechanisms, and adaptive chunk sizing based on available memory monitoring.

## Task 2: Enhanced Data Region Detection

Enhance the `_detect_data_region` method in `DataProfiler` to implement algorithm for identifying data boundaries within each worksheet, create empty region identification and classification system, implement data vs. formatting area distinction logic, add merged cell handling and boundary adjustment algorithms, create data continuity analysis to separate distinct data regions, and build footer and summary row identification capabilities.

## Task 3: Advanced Type Classification Engine

Enhance the `_infer_column_type` method in `DataProfiler` to create statistical sampling system for large datasets with >95% accuracy requirement, implement pattern matching for common data formats (dates, currencies, percentages), build confidence scoring for type classification accuracy, add mixed-type column handling with dominant type identification, create custom type detection for business-specific data patterns, and add fallback classification for ambiguous or corrupted data.

## Task 4: Enhanced Quality Metrics Calculator

Expand the quality metrics in `DataProfiler` to implement comprehensive data density calculation, create completeness scoring for each column and data region, build pattern consistency analysis for structured data validation, add outlier detection and statistical distribution analysis, create data quality scoring with weighted factors for different issues, implement duplicate row detection and reporting, and add cross-column relationship analysis for data integrity checking.

## Task 5: Smart Header Detection System

Enhance the `_detect_headers` method in `DataProfiler` to create smart header identification using statistical analysis of row content with configurable confidence thresholds, build multi-row header support for complex table structures, add header validation against common business data patterns, create header-data boundary detection with confidence scoring, implement header type classification (text, numeric, mixed content), and add header consistency validation across similar data regions.

## Task 6: Memory Management Integration

Integrate advanced memory management throughout `DataProfiler` by adding memory pressure detection with configurable warning thresholds, implement automatic garbage collection triggers at memory limits, create dynamic chunk size adjustment based on available memory, build memory usage profiling per processing operation, add early warning system when approaching memory limits, and implement cache eviction using least-recently-used algorithms.

## Task 7: Streaming Data Processing

Create `src/utils/streaming_processor.py` with row-based chunking strategy for data analysis modules, column-based processing capability for wide sheets with many columns, cell-level streaming support for formula-heavy workbooks, intermediate result persistence to disk for very large files, and progressive analysis with configurable depth levels.

## Task 8: Performance Optimization

Add performance monitoring to `DataProfiler` with processing time estimation based on file size and complexity, implement sampling strategies for workbooks with >10,000 rows per sheet, create progressive analysis with configurable depth levels, build formula parsing caching to avoid redundant processing, implement performance monitoring for data analysis operations, and add resource usage optimization recommendations.

## Task 9: Enhanced Caching System

Extend the caching system in `DataProfiler` to implement file-level caching based on modification timestamps and content hashes, create incremental analysis capability for modified workbooks with change detection, build query result caching for frequently requested analysis patterns, add precomputed indexes for common lookup operations, implement analysis result compression for storage efficiency, and create cache invalidation logic for modified source files.

## Task 10: Data Validation Framework

Create `src/utils/data_validator.py` with comprehensive data validation rules, implement business logic validation for common data patterns, add data consistency checking across related columns, create anomaly detection for unusual data patterns, implement data completeness validation with configurable thresholds, and add data format validation for structured datasets.

## Task 11: Integration Testing

Create comprehensive tests in `tests/test_phase2_integration.py` to validate all Phase 2 components working together, test memory efficiency with large files, validate processing speed meets <5 minutes per 100MB targets, test error resilience with corrupted or unusual data, validate output quality meets AI consumption standards, and create performance regression testing with baseline metrics.

## Task 12: Configuration Enhancement

Update `config/analysis_settings.yaml` with all new Phase 2 parameters, add memory management configuration options, implement chunking and streaming parameters, add data validation thresholds, create performance tuning options, and add caching configuration settings.
